This is a project for Codedex's HTML course, I had learned various semantics, structures, and forms along the way of the course. 
This projects strays from the original project description quite a bit, for stylistic choices as well as practicing linking pages. 
From start to finish, I can see my first mockup of the index page in comparison to the order form and realize how messy the code is. 
Needs more comments, Structuring could be better, and semantics like main and article could be more utilized. 
Nonetheless, I believe my project still holds up despite the spaghetti code and serves as a nice first project.
